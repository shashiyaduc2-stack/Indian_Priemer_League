# 🏏 Indian Premier League (IPL) Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing **Indian Premier League (IPL)** cricket data to
find patterns, trends, player performance insights, and match statistics using Python.

---

##  **Project Objectives**
- Analyze IPL match and player datasets  
- Understand batting and bowling performance  
- Study win margins, toss impact, team comparison  
- Build visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, Pareto charts)  
- Perform basic data modelling and insights generation

## 📂 Dataset Details
The project uses one or more IPL datasets such as:
- **matches.csv** – match-level data  
- **deliveries.csv** – ball-by-ball information  
- **teams.csv / players.csv** – player/team info
